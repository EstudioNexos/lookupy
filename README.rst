Pyharbor
========

What?
-----

A library for working with HAR (HTTP Archive) files.


Requirements
------------

Python >= 3.2


Why one more har file lib?
--------------------------

1. I wanted to extract data out of HAR files and none of the existing
   libs I found were well documented.
2. Really wanted to get started with Python 3.
3. For experimenting with stratified functional abstractions in Python.


Project Status
--------------

Just started with it. No docs. No tests. You decide!
