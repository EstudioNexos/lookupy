Pyharbor
========

What?
-----

A library for working with HAR (HTTP Archive) files.


Requirements
------------

Python >= 3.2
nose (for running tests)


Why one more har file lib?
--------------------------

1. I wanted to extract data out of HAR files and none of the existing
   libs I found were well documented.
2. Really wanted to get started with Python 3.
3. For experimenting with stratified functional abstractions in Python.


Todo
----

* Logging
* Nose tests
* Support for callables to be passed as filter lookup values
* Support for 'or', 'not equal' etc. in filter lookup
* Implement `exclude keys` function
* Implement `original_keys` function
* Implement CLI
* Document stuff
